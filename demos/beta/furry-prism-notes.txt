the first textile-like prism was produced by accident
now Leah wants me to tweak parameters to see how it affects the texture, flexibility, other material properties etc
parameters to adjust:
    - spike length
    - spike angle
    - extrusion density
    - feedrate
    - number of spikes
    - layer height
