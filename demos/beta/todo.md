Here are some ideas of structures to try generating with ExtruderTurtle, which came from other papers on the topic of 3D printing:
- hair/fur-like structure
    - different hair heights can yield a fuzzy "surface"
    - hair on curved surfaces
    - printed (paint)brush
    - velcro-like hair with an adhesion property
    - control hair stiffness?
    - control hair direction to design a "stick-slip" mechanism
    - differentiate direction of movement digitally?
    - curly/spiral hair?
    - troll/horse with textured hair/bristles
    - use blow-heating to apply post-print manipulations
- use moir√© pattern to create an interesting optical effect?
- control extruder height for interesting textures
    - stepping out of motor
    - stable road
    - zigzag road
    - coil-like road
    - frizzy hair-like road
    - straight hair-like road
    - wavy/bendy sheet?
- "quick" wireframe structures?
- bas-reliefs that optically mimic 3D structures
- deformable objects that make use of micromaterial structures
