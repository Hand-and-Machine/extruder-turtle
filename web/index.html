<p>ExtruderTurtle is a Python library that translates 3D Turtle commands into GCODE that can be run on 3D printers. In particular, it allows you to design objects that can't be generated using Slicer software. <a href="https://github.com/Hand-and-Machine/extruder-turtle">Download this library from GitHub!</a></p>

<h2>What is 3D Turtle?</h2>

<p>Turtle Geometry is an alternative paradigm for doing geometry. Whereas Euclidean Geometry is driven by axiomatic proofs and Cartesian Geometry describes figures analytically in terms of their points, Turtle Geometry adopts a more procedural mindset, making it apt for use by programmers.</p>

<p>We may conceptualize Turtle Geometry by imagining a turtle sitting on a plane, holding a pen. We may control the turtle's movement by issuing a few simple commands. For instance, we can use the command <code>FORWARD 20</code> to make the turtle move forward 20 units, or <code>RIGHT 45</code> to make the turtle turn right 45 degrees. As the turtle moves, it traces a path behind it using the pen. By combining these commands with other constructions that are common for programming languages, such as for-loops or if-statements, we can direct the turtle to draw a variety of complex and beautiful shapes. For instance, consider the following simple program, and the pleasant shape it produces:</p>

<div class="img-and-code-div" style="width: 50%;">
    <div class="code-div">
        <code><pre>
            REPEAT 10
                FORWARD 20
                RIGHT 108
        </pre></code>
    </div>
    <div class="img-div">
        <img src="img/2D_turtle_ex.png">
    </div>
</div>

<p>If you're interested in seeing more examples like this and learning more about Turtle Geometry in general, you should check out the book <a href="https://handandmachine.cs.unm.edu/classes/Computational_Fabrication_Spring2021/readings/turtle-geometry.pdf"><i>Turtle Geometry: The Computer as a Medium for Exploring Mathematics</i></a> by Abelson and diSessa.</p>

<p>The ExtruderTurtle library incorporates commands from traditional 2D Turtle Geometry, but it also uses commands from 3D Turtle, a generalization of traditional Turtle Geometry in which the Turtle can move anywhere in 3D space. The turtle can move forwards and backwards as before, but it can now rotate about three different axes. These three types of rotation are called <code>YAW</code>, <code>PITCH</code> and <code>ROLL</code>.</p>

<a id="what-is-gcode">
<h2>What is GCODE?</h2>

GCODE is a programming language used to control machines, particularly 3D printers. Each GCODE command corresponds to a particular action to be taken by the 3D printer. For instance, the command <code>G01 X10 Y20 Z30</code> will move the printer head to the position (10, 20, 30). Here's a short list of commonly-used GCODE commands:

<ul style="width: 100%;">
    <li><code>G01 Xx Yx Zz</code> moves the extruder to (x, y, z)</li>
    <img class="skinny_img" src="img/g01_diagram.png">
    <li><code>G01 Xx Yx Zz Ee</code> moves the extruder to (x, y, z) while extruding e millimeters of filament</li>
    <li><code>G01 Ee</code> extrudes e millimeters of filament in-place</li>
    <img class="skinny_img" src="img/g01e_diagram.png">
    <li><code>G01 Ff</code> sets the feedrate, or the speed of movement, to f millimeters/second</li>
    <img class="skinny_img" src="img/g01f_diagram.png">
    <li><code>G04 Pp</code> pauses for p milliseconds</li>
    <img class="skinny_img" src="img/g04_diagram.png">
    <li><code>M104 Ss</code> sets the hotend temperature to s degrees, and <code>M109 Ss</code> makes the printer wait until it is finished heating to the desired temperature</li>
    <img class="skinny_img" src="img/hotend_diagram.png">
    <li><code>M140 Ss</code> sets the bed temperature to s degrees, and <code>M190 Ss</code> makes the printer wait until it is finished heating to the desired temperature</li>
    <img class="skinny_img" src="img/heatbed_diagram.png">
    <li><code>G91</code> puts all axes in relative mode, so that all coordinates are measured relative to the current position</li>
    <img class="skinny_img" src="img/g91_diagram.png">
</ul>

There are many other GCODE commands, but these are the main ones used for 3D printing. 

The image of a turtle moving through space with a pen and tracing a path behind it is comparable to that of an extruder head moving around the print bed and leaving a trail of filament in its path. This suggests that it would be apt to implement 3D Turtle functionality using GCODE, which is exactly what the ExtruderTurtle library attempts to do. 

<a id="how-do-i-use">
<h2>How do I use ExtruderTurtle?</h2>

<p>To install the library, simpy use <code>python3 -m pip install extruder_turtle</code>.</p> If you want to use ExtruderTurtle in conjunction with Rhino, see <a href="#turtle-with-rhino">this section below</a>. 

Here's a list of ExtruderTurtle commands:

<h3>Setup</h3>

The following methods are used to set up your turtle design:

<ul>
    <li>
        The constructor <code>t = ExtruderTurtle()</code> takes no arguments and creates a new turtle with a few default parameter values in place:
        <ul>
            <li>The default output file name is "turtle.gcode"</li>
            <li>The turtle's initial orientation is pointing in the positive-x direction with its shell parallel to the xy-plane.</li>
            <li>The default starting feedrate is 0.</li>
            <li>The default extrusion density (mm of filament extruded per mm moved) is equal to zero.</li>
            <li>The pen is down by default.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>t.name("your-filename.gcode")</code> allows you to change the name of the output file.</li>
    <li>
        <code>t.setup()</code> writes the sequence of initialization commands (which moves the nozzle to its starting position, heats the bed and extruder, and so on). It takes several optional arguments that allow you to customize the setup process:
        <ul>
            <li><code>x=0</code> is the starting x-value</li>
            <li><code>y=0</code> is the starting y-value</li>
            <li><code>feedrate=100</code> is the starting feedrate</li>
            <li><code>hotend_temp=215</code> is the default hotend temperature</li>
            <li><code>bed_temp=60</code> is the default bed temperature</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>t.finish()</code> carries out the finalization sequence (which moves the extruder upwards, cools the bed and extruder, etc).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Turtle actions</h3>

Here are the commands corresponding to 3D turtle:

<ul>
    <li><code>t.forward(distance)</code> moves the turtle forward by a given distance, extruding along the way if the pen is down.</li>
    <li><code>t.left(theta)</code> turns the turtle left by a given angle. This is an alias for <code>t.yaw(theta)</code>.</li>
    <li><code>t.right(theta)</code> turns the turtle right by a given angle. This is an alias for <code>t.yaw(-theta)</code>.</li>
    <li><code>t.pitch_up(theta)</code> tilts the turtle "upwards" in the direction its eyes would point. Alias for <code>t.pitch(theta)</code>.</li>
    <li><code>t.pitch_down(theta)</code> tilts the turtle "downwards". Alias for <code>t.pitch(-theta)</code>.</li>
    <li><code>t.roll_left(theta)</code> rolls the turtle towards its left side. Alias for <code>t.roll(-theta)</code>.</li>
    <li><code>t.roll_right(theta)</code> rolls the turtle towards its right side. Alias for <code>t.roll(theta)</code>.</li>
    <li><code>t.lift(height)</code> lifts the turtle up by a given height. Usually used to move from one layer of a print to the next.</li>
    <li><code>t.forward_lift(distance, height)</code> moves the turtle diagonally forward and up by given amounts. Note that "up" does not necessarily point in the positive z-direction, but rather in the direction normal to the turtle's shell.</li>
    <li><code>t.penup()</code> lifts the pen up. No extrusion will occur until it is put down again.</li>
    <li><code>t.pendown()</code> puts the pen down. Extrusion will occur at a constant rate with each movement unless the pen is lifted up.</li>
    <li><code>t.extrude(amount)</code> extrudes a given amount of filament in-place.</li>
    <li><code>t.do(command)</code> will write a manually-specified GCODE command to the output file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

These methods are used to configure the turtle and the style of the pint:

<ul>
    <li><code>t.set_density(density)</code> sets the density of extrusion, or the rate at which filament is extruded, measured in millimeters of filament per millimeters of movement.</li>
    <li><code>t.rate(feedrate)</code> sets the feedrate of the extruder, or the "speed" of the turtle.</li>
    <li><code>t.use_degrees</code> is a boolean value, default false, that determines whether angles are interpreted as degrees or radians.</li>
    <li><code>t.track_history</code> is a boolean value, set to False by default, which stores a history of the turtle's path. Primarily used for visualization/debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample print</h3>

<p>Here's a sample program that generates GCODE for a simple seven-pointed star: </p>

<a id="turtle-with-rhino">
<h3>Using ExtruderTurtle with Rhino/Grasshopper</h3>

<p>The ExtruderTurtle library includes some built-in tools that can be used with Rhino, a piece of software for 3D modelling and visualization, and Grasshopper, a plugin for Rhino that allows users to run Python code to generate structures. Rhino/Grasshopper use IronPython only, so many newer Python modules that require versions later than Python2.7 will not work. However, ExtruderTurtle only makes use of the "math" module, making it usable from within Grasshopper.</p>

<p>To install ExtruderTurtle for Rhino on MacOS, locate the files "ExtruderTurtle.py" and "ExtruderTurtleForRhino.py" and the "data" directory inside of the <a href="https://github.com/Hand-and-Machine/extruder-turtle/tree/main/extruder_turtle">extruder_turtle directory</a> of the main repository. Copy all three of these to the following directory on your system:</p>

<center style="margin: 15px;">
<code>~/Applications/Rhino\ 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/RhCore.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/ManagedPlugIns/RhinoDLR_Python.rhp/Lib</code>
</center>

<p>Now ExtruderTurtle is installed for your Rhino client! Create a new Grasshopper file, and use the following setup to run ExtruderTurtle code:</p>

<center><img src="img/grasshopper_setup.png" style="width: 70%;"></center>

<p>The first simple Python script is used to allow Rhino to open and edit a .gcode file on your system, and when you run it, a dialog box will appear asking you to name the file. After that, you should be able to run your ExtruderTurtle code! Setting <code>t.track_history = True</code> instructs the turtle to keep a list of filament lines that it extrudes, which can be used to visualize the print in Rhino using the following code snippet:</p>

<center><img src="img/rhino_viz_example.png"></center>

<p>The third "Line" component receives the "lines" array from the second Python component and draws each line segment in Rhino's visualization model.</p>

<h2>What can you print with ExtruderTurtle?</h2>

<a id="fractal-shapes">
<h3>Fractal shapes</h3>

<p>Turtle Geometry is very effective for describing simple geometrical shapes such as the seven-pointed-star example shown earlier, but simple programs can also encode complex fractals. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-Systems</a> can be used to recursively generate sequences of turtle moves to draw fractals such as the Koch Snowflake and the Hilbert Curve: </p>

<center><img src="img/snowflake_example.png" style="width: 80%;"></center>

<center><img src="img/hilbert_example.png" style="width: 80%;"></center>

<p>Python code can easily written to iterate the substitution rules for each of these L-Systems several times, and then translate each of them into a turtle command. (In the Koch Snowflake, F R L correspond to a forward movement and a 60-degree right turn and left turn respectively, and in the Hilbert Curve, R and L represent 90-degree turns instead.) The L-System instructions are repeated several times, once for each horizontal layer, to give the fractal some thickness. </p>

<p>The Hilbert Curve has some interesting mechanical properties:</p>

<center><img src="img/hilbert_stretch.png" class="skinny_img"></center>

<a id="hairs-and-string">
<h3>Hairs and string art</h3>

<p>By printing thin, free-floating strands of filament that join to the edges of a solid frame, we can create string art. For instance, if we place a number of equally-spaced points around the circumference of a circle and join each point N to point 2N with a thin strand of plastic, we obtain an emergent cardioid shape.</p>

<p>How can we accomplish this with ExtruderTurtle? One simple way is to draw a line from point N to point 2N with the Turtle, backtrack to point N, and then move to the next point N+1 around the circumference, repeating this until all points have been visited. However, there's a more elegant solution that does not involve backtracking - instead, start at some point N, then draw a line from point N to point 2N, then draw another line directly from point 2N to point 2(2N) or 4N, and then to point 2(4N) or 8N, and so on.</p>

<p>One problem with this technique is that it does not guarantee all points will be visited. For instance, if there are 21 points and the turtle starts at point 1, it will proceed to point 2, then point 4, point 8, point 16, point 11, and back to point 1 again (since 2*16 and 2*11 are congruent to 11 and 1 modulo 21, respectively), skipping most of the points on the circle. However, if there are precisely 19 points, for example, the turtle will visit all of them (except for point zero) no matter where it starts.</p>

<center><img src="img/primitive_root_cardioids.png" style="width: 80%;"></center>

<p>In fact, in order for all points to be visited, resulting in the best-looking cardioid, the total number of points should be a number for which 2 is a primitive root. A list of such numbers can be found in <a href="http://oeis.org/A167791">OEIS A167791</a>. Here's an example printed with 67 points:</p>

<center><img src="img/cardioid_example.png" style="width: 80%;"></center>

<p>By printing free-floating strings with one end not attached to any wall, or by printing strands between two walls and cutting them off after the print is finished, we can print structures that resemble hairs or bristles: </p>

<center><img src="img/hairs.png" style="width: 60%;"></center>

<p>By printing the bristles radially outwards from a pillar, and varying their lengths from bottom to top, we can print the following structures that resemble pine trees: </p>

<center><img src="img/tree_example.png" style="width: 70%;"></center>

<p>The loops of warm plastic sag and deform slightly as they leave the hot extruder nozzle, giving these prints a more "natural" look. </p>

<a id="textures">
<h3>Interesting textures</h3>

<p>Textures can be mapped to the surfaces of objects printed using ExtruderTurtle by adding small perturbations to the turtle's path. For instance, adding a small protrusion perpendicular to the surface at several points can result in braille-like textures. Such textures have been added to the surfaces of the following two cylinders:</p>

<center><img src="img/braille_example.png" style="width: 70%;"></center>

<p>For the cylinder on the left, the braille-like dots are randomly placed with increasing frequency from bottom to top. For the cylinder on the bottom, the placement of the dots represent black cells in a 1D wrap-around cellular automaton, where the bottom layer represents the first generation and the top layer represents the last. This 1D cellular automaton was generated using <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule30.html">Wolfram's "Rule 30"</a>.</p>

<a id="nonplanar-slicing">
<h3>Nonplanar slicing</h3>

<p>Most 3D printed objects whose GCODE is generated by a slicer have completely flat layers. However, this constraint can often be detrimental. In particular, when objects have curves that are very gently sloped in the z-direction, horizontally sliced layers can lead to an ugly "stair-stepping effect" that visibly decrease the quality of the print.</p>

<p>Using ExtruderTurtle, we can print layers that are slightly concave. Because vertical movement can sometimes lead to collisions between the extruder and the print, care must be taken to ensure that the slopes are sufficiently shallow. The following star-shaped solid was printed with parabolically curved layers:</p>

<center><img src="img/nonplanar_star_example.png" style="width: 80%;"></center>

<p>The first layer is perfectly flat so that it can stick to the print bed. However, after the first layer, each layer becomes slightly more curved than the last, so that the concavity of each layer increases from bottom to top. Note that each parabola segment always starts and ends at the same height, because the summation of x/25 as x ranges from x=-25 to x=25 equals zero. That is, the sum total of all z-displacements over each turtle movement in a single parabola segment equals zero.</p> 

<p>The following vase was also printed using nonplanar slicing. Instead of parabolic curves, it has a sinusoidal curve around its rim:</p>
